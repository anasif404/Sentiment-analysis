# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project utilizes the Twitter API to fetch tweets and performs sentiment analysis using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The goal is to gain insights into public sentiment regarding specific topics or events on Twitter.

## Project Description

### 1. Data Collection

- The project starts by connecting to the Twitter API to fetch tweets in real-time.
- Various search parameters can be used to filter tweets based on keywords, hashtags, user mentions, or geolocation.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis

- The fetched tweets are then processed for sentiment analysis using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) machine learning model.
- Sentiment analysis determines whether a tweet expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
- SVC is employed due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and capturing complex relationships within the data.

### 3. Visualization and Insights

- The analyzed data can be visualized using charts or graphs to represent the overall sentiment trends.
- Insights derived from the analysis can be used for social listening, market research, or understanding public opinion on specific topics.

## Technologies Used

- **Twitter API**: Utilized for fetching real-time tweets.
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the project.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Setup Twitter API Keys**: Obtain Twitter API keys and configure them in the project.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Python libraries (Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.) are installed. You can use `pip` for installation.
3. **Run the Code**: Execute the Python script to fetch tweets and perform sentiment analysis.
4. **View Results**: Analyzed data and visualizations can be viewed in the output or exported for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement sentiment analysis using deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate natural language processing techniques for better understanding of tweet context.
- Develop a user interface for interactive user experience.
